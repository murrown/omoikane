# Omoikane

[Project Site](https://omoikane.murrown.com/)

Omoikane is a single-page web application for studying Japanese vocabulary via spaced repetition methods. It dynamically loads flashcards and stores user progress, quiz data, and lexical resources migrated from the massive JMdict dictionary. I wrote it mainly for personal use as an alternative to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), and to demonstrate my web development skills. See it in action at [omoikane.murrown.com](https://omoikane.murrown.com/).

## Technology Stack

This codebase and the [project site](https://omoikane.murrown.com/) use the following technologies:

* Python
* Django
* PostgreSQL
* TypeScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* AWS EC2
* Linux
* Nginx

## Deployment

Coming soon. The codebase is not yet ready for personal deployment; the JMdict data migrations need to be rewritten, and without those, you will not be able to populate your database with useful information (except manually, but that would be really slow).
